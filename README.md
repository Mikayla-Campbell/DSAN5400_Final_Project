# Executive Order 14151 Effects on Federally Funded Research

Brooke Bergin, Mikayla Campbell

This project serves as an inquiry into the effects of the passing of Executive Order 14151, signed January 20, 2025. It has been observed that many organizations have restricted the use of certain terminology regarding diversity, equity, and / or inclusion in their publications, following suit after the same lexical phenomenon occurred on many federal government websites. Though the executive order itself never specified exactly which words and phrases were due to be removed from federal government websites and other government publications, journalists at the New York Times searched 5,000 federal government websites and have compiled a list of 197 such terms and phrases that have been removed. As researchers anticipate the loss of funding or rejection of proposed publications over the use of these target phrases, we in turn anticipate the increasingly frequent disappearance of target phrases from publicly funded research, and aim to quantify their erasure both in the past few weeks and coming years.

We've split the list of 197 terms into 5 categories: "ability", "class", "climate", gender/sexuality ( titled "gs" ), and race/ethnicity ( titled "re" ). We've chosen 4 to 6 terms from the list of 197 terms to be representative of each category.

As a user, you'll be able to search for the frequencies with which each category's representative terms occur in our corpus of abstracts drawn from the NSF's Public Acess Repository. The result will be presented in a graph, showing the progression of usage between the months of October of 2024 and March of 2025. To run the code, run --category followed by the string of the category you'd like to see.
<br>example: <br>--category class<br>--category gs

Happy searching!
